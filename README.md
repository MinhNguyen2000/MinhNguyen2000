Me? I am an aspiring student learning robotic programming 🤖⚙️ I am passionate about data-driven and learning-based methods in robotic application

🌱 I am learning with some guidance from several courses and projects
- Self-driving and ROS 2 ([Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/self-driving-and-ros-2-learn-by-doing-odometry-control)) => bumperbot_ws repo
- IBM Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning ([Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-learning-reinforcement-learning)) => Course_IBM_DLRL repo

🦾 Robotic project that I am working on
- ROSMaster X1 Robot and ROS2 - I am working on migrating the source project from ROS1 to ROS2 so that I can leverage newer packages and longer support EOL
  => X1_ROS1_ws and X1_ROS2_ws repo

📖 Books that I am reading right now
- Introduction to Autonomous Mobile Robots (Siegwart, Nourbakhsh, and Scaramuzza)
- Understanding Deep Learning (Simon Prince) [Notebooks](https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/)
- Mastering ROS for Robotics Programming - Best practices and trouble shooting solutions when working with ROS (Lentin Joseph and Jonathan Cacace) [Repo](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-ROS-for-Robotics-Programming-Third-edition)
